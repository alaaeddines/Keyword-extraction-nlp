"A scalable model of cerebellar adaptive timing and sequencing: the recurrent,	slide and latch (RSL) model,""From the dawn of modern neural network theory, the mammalian cerebellum has"",	been a favored object of mathematical modeling studies.

The first one is a semiclassical strategy that is,	obtained by the natural extension of conventional matching strategies,	and consists of a two-stage procedure: identification (estimation) of,	the unknown template states to design the classifier (learning process,	to train the classifier) and classification of the input system into,	the appropriate pattern class based on the estimated results. The other,""	is a fully quantum strategy without any intermediate measurement, which"",	we might call as the universal quantum matching machine.

"Ride quality evaluation of an actively-controlled stretcher for an ambulance,This study considers the subjective evaluation of ride quality during ambulance,	transportation using an actively-controlled stretcher (ACS).

The algorithm was,""	based on a three-source model, in which the photon radiation to the"",	point of calculation was treated as if it originated from three,	effective sources: one source for the primary photons from the target,	and two extra-focal photon sources for the scattered photons from the,""	primary collimator and the flattening filter, respectively. The field"",""	mapping method proposed by Kim et al. [Phys. Med. Biol. 43, 1593-1604"",	(1998)] was extended to two extra-focal source planes and the scatter,	contributions were integrated over the projected areas (determined by,	the detector's eye view) in the three source planes considering the,	source intensity distributions. The algorithm was implemented using,	Microsoft Visual C/C++ in the MS Windows environment. The only input,""	data required were head scatter factors for symmetric square fields,"",	which are normally acquired during machine commissioning. A large,	number of different fields were used to evaluate the algorithm and the,	results were compared with measurements.

"Simultaneous iterative reconstruction of emission and attenuation images in,	positron emission tomography from emission data only,For quantitative image reconstruction in positron emission tomography,	attenuation correction is mandatory. In case that no data are available,	for the calculation of the attenuation correction factors one can try,""	to determine them from the emission data alone. However, it is not"",	clear if the information content is sufficient to yield an adequate,	attenuation correction together with a satisfactory activity,""	distribution. Therefore, we determined the log likelihood distribution"",	for a thorax phantom depending on the choice of attenuation and,	activity pixel values to measure the crosstalk between both. In,	addition an iterative image reconstruction (one-dimensional Newton-type,""	algorithm with a maximum likelihood estimator), which simultaneously"",	reconstructs the images of the activity distribution and the,	attenuation coefficients is used to demonstrate the problems and,	possibilities of such a reconstruction. As result we show that for a,""	change of the log likelihood in the range of statistical noise, the"",	associated change in the activity value of a structure is between 6%,""	and 263%. In addition, we show that it is not possible to choose the"",	best maximum on the basis of the log likelihood when a regularization,""	is used, because the coupling between different structures mediated by"",	the (smoothing) regularization prevents an adequate solution due to,	crosstalk. We conclude that taking into account the attenuation,	information in the emission data improves the performance of image,""	reconstruction with respect to the bias of the activities, however, the"",	reconstruction still is not quantitative"
"Mammogram synthesis using a 3D simulation. II. Evaluation of synthetic,	mammogram texture,We have evaluated a method for synthesizing mammograms by comparing the texture,	of clinical and synthetic mammograms.

"Effect of multileaf collimator leaf width on physical dose distributions in the,	treatment of CNS and head and neck neoplasms with intensity modulated,	radiation therapy,The purpose of this work is to examine physical radiation dose differences,	between two multileaf collimator (MLC) leaf widths (5 and 10 mm) in the,	treatment of CNS and head and neck neoplasms with intensity modulated,	radiation therapy (IMRT). Three clinical patients with CNS tumors were,""	planned with two different MLC leaf sizes, 5 and 10 mm, representing"",""	Varian-120 and Varian-80 Millennium multileaf collimators,"",	respectively. Two sets of IMRT treatment plans were developed. The goal,	of the first set was radiation dose conformality in three dimensions.,	The goal for the second set was organ avoidance of a nearby critical,	structure while maintaining adequate coverage of the target volume.,	Treatment planning utilized the CadPlan/Helios system (Varian Medical,""	Systems, Milpitas CA) for dynamic MLC treatment delivery. All beam"",	parameters and optimization (cost function) parameters were identical,""	for the 5 and 10 mm plans. For all cases the number of beams, gantry"",""	positions, and table positions were taken from clinically treated"",	three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy plans. Conformality was,	measured by the ratio of the planning isodose volume to the target,	volume. Organ avoidance was measured by the volume of the critical,	structure receiving greater than 90% of the prescription dose (V/sub,	90/). For three patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and,	neck (T2-T4 N0-N2c M0) 5 and 10 mm leaf widths were compared for,	parotid preservation utilizing nine coplanar equally spaced beams,	delivering a simultaneous integrated boost. Because modest differences,""	in physical dose to the parotid were detected, a NTCP model based upon"",	the clinical parameters of Eisbruch et al. was then used for,	comparisons. The conformality improved in all three CNS cases for the 5,""	mm plans compared to the 10 mm plans. For the organ avoidance plans,"",	V/sub 90/ also improved in two of the three cases when the 5 mm leaf,""	width was utilized for IMRT treatment delivery. In the third case, both"",	the 5 and 10 mm plans were able to spare the critical structure with,""	none of the structure receiving more than 90% of the prescription dose,"",""	but in the moderate dose range, less dose was delivered to the critical"",	structure with the 5 mm plan. For the head and neck cases both the 5,	and 10*2.5 mm beamlets dMLC sliding window techniques spared the,	contralateral parotid gland while maintaining target volume coverage.,	The mean parotid dose was modestly lower with the smaller beamlet size,	(21.04 Gy vs 22.36 Gy). The resulting average NTCP values were 13.72%,""	for 10 mm dMLC and 8.24% for 5 mm dMLC. In conclusion, five mm leaf"",	width results in an improvement in physical dose distribution over 10,	mm leaf width that may be clinically relevant in some cases.

"A method for geometrical verification of dynamic intensity modulated,	radiotherapy using a scanning electronic portal imaging device,In order to guarantee the safe delivery of dynamic intensity modulated,""	radiotherapy (IMRT), verification of the leaf trajectories during the"",	treatment is necessary. Our aim in this study is to develop a method,	for on-line verification of leaf trajectories using an electronic,""	portal imaging device with scanning read-out, independent of the"",	multileaf collimator. Examples of such scanning imagers are electronic,	portal imaging devices (EPIDs) based on liquid-filled ionization,	chambers and those based on amorphous silicon. Portal images were,	acquired continuously with a liquid-filled ionization chamber EPID,""	during the delivery, together with the signal of treatment progress"",""	that is generated by the accelerator. For each portal image, the"",	prescribed leaf and diaphragm positions were computed from the dynamic,	prescription and the progress information. Motion distortion effects of,	the leaves are corrected based on the treatment progress that is,	recorded for each image row. The aperture formed by the prescribed,""	leaves and diaphragms is used as the reference field edge, while the"",	actual field edge is found using a maximum-gradient edge detector. The,	errors in leaf and diaphragm position are found from the deviations,	between the reference field edge and the detected field edge. Earlier,	measurements of the dynamic EPID response show that the accuracy of the,	detected field edge is better than 1 mm. To ensure that the,	verification is independent of inaccuracies in the acquired progress,""	signal, the signal was checked with diode measurements beforehand. The"",	method was tested on three different dynamic prescriptions. Using the,""	described method, we correctly reproduced the distorted field edges."",	Verifying a single portal image took 0.1 s on an 866 MHz personal,	computer.

"Incorporating multi-leaf collimator leaf sequencing into iterative IMRT,	optimization,Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) treatment planning typically,	considers beam optimization and beam delivery as separate tasks.,""	Following optimization, a multi-leaf collimator (MLC) or other beam"",	delivery device is used to generate fluence patterns for patient,""	treatment delivery.

"Direct aperture optimization: A turnkey solution for step-and-shoot IMRT,IMRT treatment plans for step-and-shoot delivery have traditionally been,	produced through the optimization of intensity distributions (or maps),	for each beam angle.

In this,""	article, we introduce an automated planning system in which we bypass"",""	the traditional intensity optimization, and instead directly optimize"",	the shapes and the weights of the apertures. We call this approach,""	""""direct aperture optimization."""" This technique allows the user to"",""	specify the maximum number of apertures per beam direction, and hence"",	provides significant control over the complexity of the treatment,	delivery.

We have tested,	direct aperture optimization on a variety of patient cases using the,	EGS4/BEAM Monte Carlo package for our dose calculation engine. The,	results demonstrate that direct aperture optimization can produce,	highly conformal step-and-shoot treatment plans using only three to,	five apertures per beam direction. As compared with traditional,""	optimization strategies, our studies demonstrate that direct aperture"",	optimization can result in a significant reduction in both the number,	of beam segments and the number of monitor units. Direct aperture,	optimization therefore produces highly efficient treatment deliveries,	that maintain the full dosimetric benefits of IMRT"

"A leaf sequencing algorithm to enlarge treatment field length in IMRT,""With MLC-based IMRT, the maximum usable field size is often smaller than the"",	maximum field size for conventional treatments.

"Knowledge acquisition for expert systems in accounting and financial problem,	domains,""Since the mid-1980s, expert systems have been developed for a variety of"",	problems in accounting and finance.

"Formalization of weighted factors analysis,Weighted factors analysis (WeFA) has been proposed as a new approach for,""	elicitation, representation, and manipulation of knowledge about a"",""	given problem, generally at a high and strategic level. Central to this"",	proposal is that a group of experts in the area of the problem can,	identify a hierarchy of factors with positive or negative influences on,	the problem outcome. The tangible output of WeFA is a directed weighted,	graph called a WeFA graph. This is a set of nodes denoting factors that,	can directly or indirectly influence an overall aim of the graph. The,	aim is also represented by a node. Each directed arc is a direct,	influence of one factor on another. A chain of directed arcs indicates,	an indirect influence. The influences may be identified as either,""	positive or negative. For example, sales and costs are two factors that"",	influence the aim of profitability in an organization.

"Towards an ontology of approximate reason,This article introduces structural aspects in an ontology of approximate,	reason.

To gain some intuition on this problem, we"",	studied the firing times of two simple integrate-and-fire model neurons,	driven by a correlated binary variable that represents the total input,	current.

"Dynamic spectrum management for next-generation DSL systems,The performance of DSL systems is severely constrained by crosstalk due to the,	electromagnetic coupling among the multiple twisted pairs making up a,	phone cable. In order to reduce performance loss arising from,""	crosstalk, DSL systems are currently designed under the assumption of"",	worst-case crosstalk scenarios leading to overly conservative DSL,	deployments. This article presents a new paradigm for DSL system,""	design, which takes into account the multi-user aspects of the DSL"",	transmission environment. Dynamic spectrum management (DSM) departs,	from the current design philosophy by enabling transceivers to,	autonomously and dynamically optimize their communication settings with,	respect to both the channel and the transmissions of neighboring,""	systems. Along with this distributed optimization, when an additional"",""	degree of coordination becomes available for future DSL deployment, DSM"",	will allow even greater improvement in DSL performance.

"Process planning for reliable high-speed machining of moulds,A method of generating NC programs for the high-speed milling of moulds is,""	investigated. Forging dies and injection moulds, whether plastic or"",""	aluminium, have a complex surface geometry. In addition they are made"",""	of steels of hardness as much as 30 or even 50 HRC. Since 1995,"",""	high-speed machining has been much adopted by the die-making industry,"",	which with this technology can reduce its use of Sinking,""	Electrodischarge Machining (SEDM). EDM, in general, calls for longer"",	machining times. The use of high-speed machining makes it necessary to,""	redefine the preliminary stages of the process. In addition, it affects"",""	the methodology employed in the generation of NC programs, which"",	requires the use of high-level CAM software. The aim is to generate,	error-free programs that make use of optimum cutting strategies in the,	interest of productivity and surface quality. The final result is a,	more reliable manufacturing process. There are two risks in the use of,""	high-speed milling on hardened steels. One of these is tool breakage,"",	which may be very costly and may furthermore entail marks on the,	workpiece. The other is collisions between the tool and the workpiece,""	or fixtures, the result of which may be damage to the ceramic bearings"",	in the spindles. in order to minimize these risks it is necessary that,	new control and optimization steps be included in the CAM methodology.,	There are three things that the firm adopting high-speed methods should,""	do.

"Deadlock-free scheduling in flexible manufacturing systems using Petri nets,This paper addresses the deadlock-free scheduling problem in Flexible,	Manufacturing Systems. An efficient deadlock-free scheduling algorithm,""	was developed, using timed Petri nets, for a class of FMSs called"",	Systems of Sequential Systems with Shared Resources (S/sup 4/ R). The,	algorithm generates a partial reachability graph to find the optimal or,	near-optimal deadlock-free schedule in terms of the firing sequence of,	the transitions of the Petri net model. The objective is to minimize,""	the mean flow time (MFT). An efficient truncation technique, based on"",""	the siphon concept, has been developed and used to generate the minimum"",	necessary portion of the reachability graph to be searched. It has been,	shown experimentally that the developed siphon truncation technique,	enhances the ability to develop deadlock-free schedules of systems with,""	a high number of deadlocks, which cannot be achieved using standard"",""	Petri net scheduling approaches. It may be necessary, in some cases, to"",	relax the optimality condition for large FMSs in order to make the,""	search effort reasonable.

"""Handles and exception safety, Part 1. A simple handle class"",Every C++ program that uses inheritance must manage memory somehow.

"A heuristic approach to resource locations in broadband networks,""In broadband networks, such as ATM, the importance of dynamic migration of data"",	resources is increasing because of its potential to improve performance,	especially for transaction processing. In environments with migratory,""	data resources, it is necessary to have mechanisms to manage the"",""	locations of each data resource. In this paper, we present an algorithm"",	that makes use of system state information and heuristics to manage,	locations of data resources in a distributed network. In the proposed,""	algorithm, each site maintains information about state of other sites"",	with respect to each data resource of the system and uses it to find:,	(1) a subset of sites likely to have the requested data resource; and,	(2) the site where the data resource is to be migrated from the current,	site. The proposed algorithm enhances its effectiveness by continuously,	updating system state information stored at each site. It focuses on,	reducing the overall average time delay needed by the transaction,	requests to locate and access the migratory data resources. We,	evaluated the performance of the proposed algorithm and also compared,""	it with one of the existing location management algorithms, by"",	simulation studies under several system parameters such as the,""	frequency of requests generation, frequency of data resource"",""	migrations, network topology and scale of network.

"Adaptive thinning for bivariate scattered data,This paper studies adaptive thinning strategies for approximating a large set,	of scattered data by piecewise linear functions over triangulated,	subsets.

"An experimental evaluation of comprehensibility aspects of knowledge structures,	derived through induction techniques: a case study of industrial fault,	diagnosis,Machine induction has been extensively used in order to develop knowledge bases,	for decision support systems and predictive systems. The extent to,	which developers and domain experts can comprehend these knowledge,	structures and gain useful insights into the basis of decision making,	has become a challenging research issue. This article examines the,	knowledge structures generated by the C4.5 induction technique in a,	fault diagnostic task and proposes to use a model of human learning in,	order to guide the process of making comprehensive the results of,	machine induction. The model of learning is used to generate,	hierarchical representations of diagnostic knowledge by adjusting the,	level of abstraction and varying the goal structures between 'shallow',	and 'deep' ones. Comprehensibility is assessed in a global way in an,	experimental comparison where subjects are required to acquire the,	knowledge structures and transfer to new tasks. This method of,	addressing the issue of comprehensibility appears promising especially,	for machine induction techniques that are rather inflexible with regard,	to the number and sorts of interventions allowed to system developers"

"On a general constitutive description for the inelastic and failure behavior of,	fibrous laminates. I. Lamina theory,It is well known that a structural design with isotropic materials can only be,""	accomplished based on a stress failure criterion.

Only when the laminate is,""	subjected to an in-plane load, can the ultimate failure of the laminate"",""	correspond to its last-ply failure, and hence a stress failure"",	criterion may be sufficient to detect the maximum load that can be,""	sustained by the laminate. Even in such a case, the load shared by each"",	lamina in the laminate cannot be correctly determined if the lamina,""	instantaneous stiffness matrix is inaccurately provided, since the"",""	lamina is always statically indeterminate in the laminate. If, however,"",""	the laminate is subjected to a lateral load, its ultimate failure"",	occurs before last-ply failure and use of the stress failure criterion,	is no longer sufficient; an additional critical deflection or curvature,	condition must also be employed. This necessitates development of an,	efficient constitutive relationship for laminated composites in order,	that the laminate strains/deflections up to ultimate failure can be,	accurately calculated. A general constitutive description for the,	thermomechanical response of a fibrous laminate up to ultimate failure,	with applications to various fibrous laminates is presented in the two,	papers.

"Design of a stroke dependent damper for the front axle suspension of a truck,	using multibody system dynamics and numerical optimization,A stroke dependent damper is designed for the front axle suspension of a truck.,	The damper supplies extra damping for inward deflections rising above 4,	cm.

"""Linear, parameter-varying control and its application to a turbofan engine"",This paper describes application of parameter-dependent control design methods,""	to a turbofan engine. Parameter-dependent systems are linear systems,"",	whose state-space descriptions are known functions of time-varying,	parameters.

"""Streaming, disruptive interference and power-law behavior in the exit dynamics"",	of confined pedestrians,We analyze the exit dynamics of pedestrians who are initially confined in a,	room.

"Combining spatial and scale-space techniques for edge detection to provide a,	spatially adaptive wavelet-based noise filtering algorithm,New methods for detecting edges in an image using spatial and scale-space,	domains are proposed. A priori knowledge about geometrical,	characteristics of edges is used to assign a probability factor to the,	chance of any pixel being on an edge. An improved double thresholding,	technique is introduced for spatial domain filtering. Probabilities,	that pixels belong to a given edge are assigned based on pixel,""	similarity across gradient amplitudes, gradient phases and edge"",	connectivity. The scale-space approach uses dynamic range compression,	to allow wavelet correlation over a wider range of scales. A,	probabilistic formulation is used to combine the results obtained from,	filtering in each domain to provide a final edge probability image,	which has the advantages of both spatial and scale-space domain,	methods. Decomposing this edge probability image with the same wavelet,	as the original image permits the generation of adaptive filters that,	can recognize the characteristics of the edges in all wavelet detail,	and approximation images regardless of scale.

"Lossy to lossless object-based coding of 3-D MRI data,We propose a fully three-dimensional (3-D) object-based coding system,	exploiting the diagnostic relevance of the different regions of the,	volumetric data for rate allocation.

"Self-calibration from image derivatives,This study investigates the problem of estimating camera calibration parameters,	from image motion fields induced by a rigidly moving camera with,""	unknown parameters, where the image formation is modeled with a linear"",	pinhole-camera model.

We have systematically evaluated via,""	computer simulations the impact of scattered radiation, the"",""	polyenergetic spectrum, and measurement noise on the performance of"",	three reconstruction algorithms: conventional filtered backprojection,""	(FBP), deterministic iterative deblurring, and a new iterative"",""	algorithm, alternating minimization (AM), based on a CT detector model"",""	that includes noise, scatter, and polyenergetic spectra. Contrary to"",""	the dominant view of the literature, FBP streaking artifacts are due"",	mostly to mismatches between FBP's simplified model of CT detector,	response and the physical process of signal acquisition. Artifacts on,	AM images are significantly mitigated as this algorithm substantially,""	reduces detector-model mismatches. However, metal artifacts are reduced"",	to acceptable levels only when prior knowledge of the metal object in,""	the patient, including its pose, shape, and attenuation map, are used"",""	to constrain AM's iterations. AM image reconstruction, in combination"",	with object-constrained CT to estimate the pose of metal objects in the,""	patient, is a promising approach for effectively mitigating metal"",	artifacts and making quantitative estimation of tissue attenuation,	coefficients a clinical possibility"
"Matching PET and CT scans of the head and neck area: Development of method and,	validation,Positron emission tomography (PET) provides important information on tumor,""	biology, but lacks detailed anatomical information. Our aim in the"",	present study was to develop and validate an automatic registration,	method for matching PET and CT scans of the head and neck. Three,	difficulties in achieving this goal are (1) nonrigid motions of the,	neck can hamper the use of automatic ridged body transformations; (2),	emission scans contain too little anatomical information to apply,	standard image fusion methods; and (3) no objective way exists to,	quantify the quality of the match results. These problems are solved as,	follows: accurate and reproducible positioning of the patient was,	achieved by using a radiotherapy treatment mask. The proposed method,	makes use of the transmission rather than the emission scan. To obtain,""	sufficient (anatomical) information for matching, two bed positions for"",	the transmission scan were included in the protocol. A mutual,	information-based algorithm was used as a registration technique. PET,	and CT data were obtained in seven patients. Each patient had two CT,	scans and one PET scan. The datasets were used to estimate the,""	consistency by matching PET to CT/sub 1/, CT/sub 1/ to CT/sub 2/, and"",	CT/sub 2/ to PET using the full circle consistency test. It was found,""	that using our method, consistency could be obtained of 4 mm and 1.3"",""	degrees on average. The PET voxels used for registration were 5.15 mm,"",	so the errors compared quite favorably with the voxel size. Cropping,	the images (removing the scanner bed from images) did not improve the,""	consistency of the algorithm. The transmission scan, however, could"",	potentially be reduced to a single position using this approach. In,""	conclusion, the represented algorithm and validation technique has"",	several features that are attractive from both theoretical and,""	practical point of view, it is a user-independent, automatic validation"",""	technique for matching CT and PET scans of the head and neck, which"",	gives the opportunity to compare different image enhancements"

"Global stability of the attracting set of an enzyme-catalysed reaction system,The essential feature of enzymatic reactions is a nonlinear dependency of,	reaction rate on metabolite concentration taking the form of saturation,""	kinetics. Recently, it has been shown that this feature is associated"",""	with the phenomenon of """"loss of system coordination"""" (Liu, 1999). In"",""	this paper, we study a system of ordinary differential equations"",	representing a branched biochemical system of enzyme-mediated,	reactions. We show that this system can become very sensitive to,""	changes in certain maximum enzyme activities. In particular, we show"",""	that the system exhibits three distinct responses: a unique,"",""	globally-stable steady-state, large amplitude oscillations, and"",""	asymptotically unbounded solutions, with the transition between these"",	states being almost instantaneous. It is shown that the appearance of,""	large amplitude, stable limit cycles occurs due to a """"false"""""",	bifurcation or canard explosion. The subsequent disappearance of limit,	cycles corresponds to the collapse of the domain of attraction of the,	attracting set for the system and occurs due to a global bifurcation in,""	the flow, namely, a saddle connection. Subsequently, almost all"",	nonnegative data become unbounded under the action of the dynamical,	system and correspond exactly to loss of system coordination. We,	discuss the relevance of these results to the possible consequences of,	modulating such systems"
"A spatial rainfall simulator for crop production modeling in Southern Africa,This paper describes a methodology for simulating rainfall in dekads across a,	set of spatial units in areas where long-term meteorological records,	are available for a small number of sites only.

Only a limited number of meteorological stations,	are available within or surrounding the district that have long time,	series of rainfall records. Preliminary analysis of rainfall data for,	these stations suggested that intra-seasonal temporal correlation was,""	negligible, but that rainfall at any given station was correlated with"",	rainfall at neighbouring stations. This spatial correlation structure,	can be modeled using a multivariate normal distribution consisting of,""	30 related variables, representing dekadly rainfall in each of the 30"",""	wards.

"When a better interface and easy navigation aren't enough: examining the,	information architecture in a law enforcement agency,An information architecture that allows users to easily navigate through a,	system and quickly recover from mistakes is often defined as a highly,	usable system.

"""Presentation media, information complexity, and learning outcomes"",Multimedia computing provides a variety of information presentation modality,	combinations. Educators have observed that visuals enhance learning,	which suggests that multimedia presentations should be superior to,	text-only and text with static pictures in facilitating optimal human,""	information processing and, therefore, comprehension.

"On batch-constructing B/sup +/-trees: algorithm and its performance evaluation,Efficient construction of indexes is very important in bulk-loading a database,	or adding a new index to an existing database since both of them should,""	handle an enormous volume of data. In this paper, we propose an"",""	algorithm for batch-constructing the B/sup +/-tree, the most widely"",	used index structure in database systems. The main characteristic of,	our algorithm is to simultaneously process all the key values to be,	placed on each B+-tree page when accessing the page. This avoids the,""	overhead due to accessing the same page multiple times, which results"",	from applying the B+-tree insertion algorithm repeatedly. For,""	performance evaluation, we have analyzed our algorithm in terms of the"",	number of disk accesses. The results show that the number of disk,	accesses excluding those in the relocation process is identical to the,	number of pages belonging to the B/sup +/-tree. Considering that the,	relocation process is an unavoidable preprocessing step for,""	batch-constructing of B/sup +/-trees, our algorithm requires just one"",""	disk access per B+-tree page, and therefore turns out to be optimal. We"",	also present the performance tendency in relation with different,""	parameter values via simulation.

"Self-organizing feature maps predicting sea levels,""In this paper, a new method for predicting sea levels employing self-organizing"",	feature maps is introduced.

"Geometric source separation: merging convolutive source separation with,	geometric beamforming,Convolutive blind source separation and adaptive beamforming have a similar,	goal-extracting a source of interest (or multiple sources) while,	reducing undesired interferences.

"Meshed atlases for real-time procedural solid texturing,We describe an implementation of procedural solid texturing that uses the,""	texture atlas, a one-to-one mapping from an object's surface into its"",	texture space.

"Design and manufacture of a lightweight piezo-composite curved actuator,""In this paper we are concerned with the design, manufacture and performance"",	test of a lightweight piezo-composite curved actuator (called LIPCA),	using a top carbon fiber composite layer with near-zero coefficient of,""	thermal expansion (CTE), a middle PZT ceramic wafer, and a bottom"",	glass/epoxy layer with a high CTE.

"A fundamental investigation into large strain recovery of one-way shape memory,	alloy wires embedded in flexible polyurethanes,Shape memory alloys (SMAs) are being embedded in or externally attached to,	smart structures because of the large amount of actuation deformation,	and force that these materials are capable of producing when they are,	heated. Previous investigations have focused primarily on using single,	or opposing SMA wires exhibiting the two-way shape memory effect (SME),	because of the simplicity with which the repeatable actuation behavior,	of the structure can be predicted. This repeatable actuation behavior,	is achieved at the expense of reduced levels of recoverable,""	deformation. Alternatively, many potential smart structure applications"",	will employ multiple SMA wires exhibiting a permanent one-way SME to,	simplify fabrication and increase the recoverable strains in the,""	structure.

Eliasmith,	hopes that it is evident that he does not claim that the process in,""	neural systems is discrete, but rather that a complete characterization"",	of the process can be discrete; these of course are significantly,	different claims"
"The importance of continuity: a reply to Chris Eliasmith,""In his reply to Eliasmith (see ibid., vol.11, p.417-26, 2001) Poznanski"",	considers how the notion of continuity of dynamic representations,	serves as a beacon for an integrative neuroscience to emerge. He,	considers how the importance of continuity has come under attack from,	Eliasmith (2001) who claims: (i) continuous nature of neurons is not,""	relevant to the information they process, and (ii) continuity is not"",	important for understanding cognition because the various sources of,""	noise introduce uncertainty into spike arrival times, so encoding and"",	decoding spike trains must be discrete at some level"
