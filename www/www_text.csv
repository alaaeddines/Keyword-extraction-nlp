Advertising keyword generation using active learning This paper proposes an efficient relevance feedback based interactive model for keyword generation in sponsored search advertising. We formulate the ranking of relevant terms as a supervised learning problem and suggest new terms for the seed by leveraging user relevance feedback information. Active learning is employed to select the most informative samples from a set of candidate terms for user labeling. Experiments show our approach improves the relevance of generated terms significantly with little user effort required.

A search-based method for forecasting ad impression in contextual advertising Contextual advertising (also called content match) refers to the placement of small textual ads within the content of a generic web page. It has become a significant source of revenue for publishers ranging from individual bloggers to major newspapers. At the same time it is an important way for advertisers to reach their intended audience. This reach depends on the total number of exposures of the ad (impressions) and its click-through-rate (CTR) that can be viewed as the probability of an end-user clicking on the ad when shown. These two orthogonal

SourceRank: relevance and trust assessment for deep web sources based on inter-source agreement One immediate challenge in searching the deep web databases is source selection - i.e. selecting the most relevant web databases for answering a given query. The existing database selection methods (both text and relational) assess the source quality based on the query-similarity-based relevance assessment. When applied to the deep web these methods have two deficiencies. First is that the methods are agnostic to the correctness (trustworthiness) of the sources. Secondly

Anonymizing user profiles for personalized web search We study the problem of anonymizing user profiles so that user privacy is sufficiently protected while the anonymized profiles are still effective in enabling personalized web search. We propose a Bayes-optimal privacy notion to bound the prior and posterior probability of associating a user with an individual term in the anonymized user profile set. We also propose a novel bundling technique that clusters user profiles into groups by taking into account the semantic relationships between the terms while satisfying the privacy constraint. We evaluate our approach through a set of preliminary experiments using real data demonstrating its feasibility and effectiveness.

Unsupervised query segmentation using only query logs We introduce an unsupervised query segmentation scheme that uses query logs as the only resource and can effectively capture the structural units in queries. We believe that Web search queries have a unique syntactic structure which is distinct from that of English or a bag-of-words model. The segments discovered by our scheme help understand this underlying grammatical structure. We apply a statistical model based on Hoeffding's Inequality to mine significant word n-grams from queries and subsequently use them for segmenting the queries. Evaluation against manually segmented queries shows that this technique can detect rare units that are missed by our Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) baseline.
The web of topics: discovering the topology of topic evolution in a corpus In this paper we study how to discover the evolution of topics over time in a time-stamped document collection.

The model parameters are learned using a tune set which is algorithmically generated using a versioned authoritative web resource as a proxy. We evaluate the proposed methodology over a corpus of Indian textbooks which demonstrates its effectiveness in identifying enrichment candidates.

The Matchbox system makes use of content information in the form of user and item meta data in combination with collaborative filtering information from previous user behavior in order to predict the value of an item for a user. Users and items are represented by feature vectors which are mapped into a low-dimensional `trait space' in which similarity is measured in terms of inner products. The model can be trained from different types of feedback in order to learn user-item preferences. Here we present three alternatives: direct observation of an absolute rating each user gives to some items

Fast dynamic reranking in large graphs In this paper we consider the problem of re-ranking search results by incorporating user feedback. We present a graph theoretic measure for discriminating irrelevant results from relevant results using a few labeled examples provided by the user. The key intuition is that nodes relatively closer (in graph topology) to the relevant nodes than the irrelevant nodes are more likely to be relevant. We present a simple sampling algorithm to evaluate this measure at specific nodes of interest
Community gravity: measuring bidirectional effects by trust and rating on online social networks Several attempts have been made to analyze customer behavior on online E-commerce sites.

Mining for personal name aliases on the web We propose a novel approach to find aliases of a given name from the web. We exploit a set of known names and their aliases as training data and extract lexical patterns that convey information related to aliases of names from text snippets returned by a web search engine. The patterns are then used to find candidate aliases of a given name. We use anchor texts and hyperlinks to design a word co-occurrence model and define numerous ranking scores to evaluate the association between a name and its candidate aliases. The proposed method outperforms numerous baselines and previous work on alias extraction on a dataset of personal names
Social and semantics analysis via non-negative matrix factorization Social media such as Web forum often have dense interactions between user and content where network models are often appropriate for analysis. Joint non-negative matrix factorization model of participation and content data can be viewed as a bipartite graph model between users and media and is proposed for analysis social media. The factorizations allow simultaneous automatic discovery of leaders and sub-communities in the Web forum as well as the core latent topics in the forum. Results on topic detection of Web forums and cluster analysis show that social features are highly effective for forum analysis.

Robust methodologies for modeling web click distributions Metrics such as click counts are vital to online businesses but their measurement has been problematic due to inclusion of high variance robot traffic. We posit that by applying statistical methods more rigorous than have been employed to date that we can build a robust model of thedistribution of clicks following which we can set probabilistically sound thresholds to address outliers and robots. Prior research in this domain has used inappropriate statistical methodology to model distributions and current industrial practice eschews this research for conservative ad-hoc click-level thresholds. Prevailing belief is that such distributions are scale-free power law distributions but using more rigorous statistical methods we find the best description of the data is instead provided by a scale-sensitive Zipf-Mandelbrot mixture distribution. Our results are based on ten data sets from various verticals in the Yahoo domain. Since mixture models can overfit the data we take care to use the BIC log-likelihood method which penalizes overly complex models. Using a mixture model in the web activity domain makes sense because there are likely multiple classes of users. In particular

Estimating the cardinality of RDF graph patterns Most RDF query languages allow for graph structure search through a conjunction of triples which is typically processed using join operations. A key factor in optimizing joins is determining the join order which depends on the expected cardinality of intermediate results. This work proposes a pattern-based summarization framework for estimating the cardinality of RDF graph patterns. We present experiments on real world and synthetic datasets which confirm the feasibility of our approach.

Multi-factor clustering for a marketplace search interface Search engines provide a small window to the vast repository of data they index and against which they search. They try their best to return the documents that are of relevance to the user but often a large number of results may be returned. Users struggle to manage this vast result set looking for the items of interest. Clustering search results is one way of alleviating this navigational pain. In this paper we describe a clustering system that enables clustering search results in an online marketplace search system.

Learning information diffusion process on the web Many text documents on the Web are not originally created but forwarded or copied from other source documents. The phenomenon of document forwarding or transmission between various web sites is denoted as Web information diffusion. This paper focuses on mining information diffusion processes for specific topics on the Web. A novel system called LIDPW is proposed to address this problem using matching learning techniques. The source site and source document of each document are identified and the diffusion process composed of a sequence of diffusion relationships is visually presented to users. The effectiveness of LIDPW is validated on a real data set. A preliminary user study is performed and the results show that LIDPW does benefit users to monitor the information diffusion process of a specific topic

An adaptive crawler for locating hidden-Web entry points In this paper we describe new adaptive crawling strategies to efficiently locate the entry points to hidden-Web sources. The fact that hidden-Web sources are very sparsely distributedmakes the problem of locating them especially challenging.

We propose a new frameworkwhereby crawlers automatically learn patterns of promisinglinks and adapt their focus as the crawl progresses

Deriving knowledge from figures for digital libraries Figures in digital documents contain important information. Current digital libraries do not summarize and index information available within figures for document retrieval. We present our system on automatic categorization of figures and extraction of data from 2-D plots. A machine-learning based method is used to categorize figures into a set of predefined types based on image features. An automated algorithm is designed to extract data values from solid line curves in 2-D plots. The semantic type of figures and extracted data values from 2-D plots can be integrated with textual information within documents to provide more effective document retrieval services for digital library users. Experimental evaluation has demonstrated that our system can produce results suitable for real-world use.

Flexible on-device service object replication with replets An increasingly large amount of Web applications employ service objects such as Servlets to generate dynamic and personalized content. Existing caching infrastructures are not well suited for caching such content in mobile environments because of disconnection and weak connection. One possible approach to this problem is to replicate Web-related application logic to client devices. The challenges to this approach are to deal with client devices that exhibit huge divergence in resource availabilities

Privacy diffusion on the web: a longitudinal perspective For the last few years we have been studying the diffusion of private information for users as they visit various Web sites triggering data gathering aggregation by third parties. This paper reports on our longitudinal study consisting of multiple snapshots of our examination of such diffusion over four years. We examine the various technical ways by which third-party aggregators acquire data and the depth of user-related information acquired. We study techniques for protecting privacy diffusion as well as limitations of such techniques. We introduce the concept of secondary privacy damage. Our results show increasing aggregation of user-related data by a steadily decreasing number of entities. A handful of companies are able to track users' movement across almost all of the popular Web sites. Virtually all the protection techniques have significant limitations highlighting the seriousness of the problem and the need for alternate solutions.
